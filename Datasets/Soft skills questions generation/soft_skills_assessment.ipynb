    "### What is Clustering?\n",
    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that groups similar data points together. For student group formation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Student Profiling**: Identify students with similar skill patterns, learning styles, and characteristics\n",
    "2. **Heterogeneous Group Creation**: Form diverse groups by selecting students from different clusters\n",
    "3. **Balanced Team Composition**: Ensure each group has complementary skills and perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications in Educational Settings:\n",
    "- **Collaborative Learning**: Create balanced teams for projects and assignments\n",
    "- **Peer Learning**: Match students with complementary strengths and weaknesses  \n",
    "- **Skill Development**: Expose students to diverse perspectives and approaches\n",
    "- **Bias Reduction**: Remove instructor bias from manual group formation\n",
    "- **Improved Outcomes**: Research shows heterogeneous groups enhance learning and critical thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering Process for Group Formation:\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: Gather student data (moyenne, skills, learning styles, interests, specializations)\n",
    "2. **Clustering**: Group students with similar profiles using ML algorithms\n",
    "3. **Group Formation**: Select one student from each cluster to create diverse teams\n",
    "4. **Validation**: Ensure groups are balanced across key attributes"
